/*
 * OrionPack stub -- key_scatter.h
 *
 * Dynamic key-fragment scattering. After the runtime AES key is derived it is
 * split into 8 fragments that are scattered across independent, randomly-offset
 * VirtualAlloc'd pages (each fragment XOR-masked with its own pad, buried in a
 * page of random noise). The fragment table itself is kept XOR-encrypted at
 * rest. The intent: no single contiguous memory dump ever captures the whole
 * 32-byte key in the clear, and the fragments relocate between section decrypts.
 *
 * Freestanding / no-CRT: implemented with Win32 (VirtualAlloc/VirtualFree),
 * bcrypt (BCryptGenRandom) and MSVC intrinsics (__stosb/__movsb) only.
