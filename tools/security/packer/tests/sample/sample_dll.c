 * Has a DllMain that sets an in-image marker on DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, plus a
 * thread-local counter exercised from both the loading thread and a new worker.
 * This proves the packed DLL's stub DllMain unpacked the image, dispatched the
 * original DllMain, and initialized static TLS for DLL_THREAD_ATTACH before an
 * export runs on that worker.
 * (per plan §7: the OS runs DllMain to completion before LoadLibrary returns).
 *
 * Compiled as C (cl default for .c). x64 has no name decoration for a cdecl
 * __declspec(dllexport), so the export is visible as "sample_dll_value".
