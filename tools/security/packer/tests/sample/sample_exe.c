 * sample_exe.c -- OrionPack round-trip acceptance target (console EXE).
 *
 * Deliberately compiled AS C++ (cl /TP /EHsc, see build_samples.ps1) so the
 * throw/catch below lowers to real x64 SEH / unwind data (.pdata + .xdata) --
 * that exercises the packer's RtlAddFunctionTable path. The __declspec(thread)
 * global exercises the packer's TLS handling (IMAGE_TLS_DIRECTORY: index, raw
 * data, zero-fill, callback list). Together these cover plan Verification #2's
 * "a __declspec(thread), a C++ throw/catch (to exercise TLS + x64 SEH)".
 *
 * Contract for the harness (roundtrip.ps1):
 *   stdout (exactly):  OrionPack sample_exe: tls=105 caught=-1
 *   exit code:         42
 * Both the original and the packed build MUST produce identical stdout + code.
