.SYNOPSIS
    Freeze the OrionPack GUI (gui/app.py) into a single OrionPack.exe with Nuitka.

.DESCRIPTION
    Produces a standalone, one-file OrionPack.exe -- the clickable internal build
    tool. It embeds the packer library, its PE/crypto dependencies (LIEF +
    cryptography), the PySide6 runtime, and the prebuilt native stub as bundled
    data. OrionPack produces protected first-party binaries and is never shipped
    to customers, so freezing it is fine.

    Mirrors the project's proven Nuitka recipe (docs/IP_PROTECTION_PLAN.md
    ~lines 315-318: the OrionSidecar standalone build) -- same
    --standalone / --assume-yes-for-downloads / --windows-console-mode=disable
    spine, plus --onefile and the PySide6 plugin.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    EXACT INVOCATION (what this script runs; paths shown relative to repo root
    tools/security/packer):

        python -m nuitka ^
            --standalone ^
            --onefile ^
            --assume-yes-for-downloads ^
            --enable-plugin=pyside6 ^
            --windows-console-mode=disable ^
            --include-package=packer ^
            --include-package=lief ^
            --include-package=cryptography ^
            --include-data-files=<repo>/tools/security/packer/stub/prebuilt/orion_stub_x64.dll=stub/prebuilt/orion_stub_x64.dll ^
            --output-filename=OrionPack.exe ^
            --output-dir=<packer>/build ^
            --remove-output ^
            gui/app.py

    Why the explicit --include-package flags: app.py imports the packer core
    lazily (on the worker thread), and the core imports LIEF / cryptography
    inside submodules. Nuitka's static import analysis can miss those deferred
    imports, so we force-include the whole packages -- exactly the lever the
    generic Nuitka command missed for the sidecar (IP_PROTECTION_PLAN.md:310-314).

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    STUB-PATH RESOLUTION REQUIREMENT (the assembler MUST honor this):

    The prebuilt native stub is bundled as DATA at the dist-relative path
    "stub/prebuilt/orion_stub_x64.dll". At runtime pack_file()/assemble.py must
    locate it RELATIVE TO the packer package -- specifically, the PARENT of the
    `packer` package directory -- which resolves correctly in BOTH modes:

        # in packer/assemble.py (or wherever the stub is loaded):
        _here = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))   # .../packer
        _root = os.path.dirname(_here)                       # dist root (frozen)
                                                             #  OR tools/security/packer (source)
        STUB_PATH = os.path.join(_root, "stub", "prebuilt", "orion_stub_x64.dll")

      * Source run:  _root = tools/security/packer, so the stub is found at
                     tools/security/packer/stub/prebuilt/orion_stub_x64.dll.
      * Frozen one-file: Nuitka extracts everything to a temp dist dir; the
                     `packer` package lands at <dist>/packer and the bundled
                     data at <dist>/stub/prebuilt/orion_stub_x64.dll, so the
                     same parent-of-package join lands on it.

    The DEST half of --include-data-files below is chosen to make that single
    resolution rule work unchanged in both cases. Do NOT resolve the stub from
    sys.argv[0]/sys.executable -- for one-file builds those point at the ORIGINAL
    exe, not the temp dist dir where the data actually lives.

.PARAMETER PythonExe
    Python interpreter to build with. Default: "python".

.PARAMETER OutputDir
    Where OrionPack.exe is written. Default: <packer>/build.

.PARAMETER StubPath
    Path to the prebuilt native stub to bundle.
    Default: <packer>/stub/prebuilt/orion_stub_x64.dll.

.PARAMETER NoOnefile
    Build a --standalone .dist/ folder instead of a single .exe (faster to
    iterate; useful for debugging what got bundled).

.PARAMETER SkipStubCheck
    Build even if the prebuilt stub is missing (the resulting exe cannot pack
    until the stub is present -- for smoke-testing the freeze only).

.NOTES
    Toolchain (proven for this repo, IP_PROTECTION_PLAN.md:301-322):
      * Python  : pin to 3.13 for release freezes (the sidecar build ran on
                  3.13; Nuitka flags 3.14 as experimental). 3.11/3.12 also work.
      * Nuitka  : >= 4.1.3 (the version that built OrionSidecar).
      * MSVC    : Visual Studio 2022 C++ toolset (14.x); Nuitka auto-detects it
                  and, with --assume-yes-for-downloads, fetches ccache /
                  dependency-walker without prompting.
      * PySide6 : LGPL, the same Qt stack the app uses; --enable-plugin=pyside6
                  bundles the required Qt plugins.

    Install the build deps into the build interpreter first:
        python -m pip install nuitka PySide6 lief cryptography

    First-time onefile Qt builds are large and can take several minutes.
